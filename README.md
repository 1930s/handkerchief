# Handkerchief - a trivial offline issue reader for GitHub Issues

This script allows you to easily download the open issues of a GitHub
Repository and store them in a single easily browsable, standalone html file.

## The name

I chose the name, because the obvious pun name "tissues" was already taken. It
also fits, because being offline is somewhat oldfashioned, just like the word
handkerchief.

## Usage

Just call the script with the user or organisation and repository name

    handkerchief.py jreinhardt/tissues
